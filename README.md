# Description of The Project

Ceaser-Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

It is a type of substitution cipher whereby each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter, some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, and E, B.
